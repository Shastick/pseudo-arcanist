# Gitlab Bash Scripts

`diff.sh` and `land.sh` are two standalone scripts that will roughly let you emulate `arc diff` and `arc land` with gitlab,
relying on the `glab` cli tool written by [profclems](https://github.com/profclems/glab).

You'll need to install and setup [glab](https://github.com/profclems/glab#installation) for the scripts to work.
